# SummerDevelopment
To put the learned concepts to the test, review these concepts, and acquire new technologies and programming languages while enhancing logical reasoning, I will undertake projects in different languages.

## 01. Snake Game in Java

**Description:** My first project was a classic Snake game developed in Java. It had the purpose of refreshing Java concepts, to be able to make a complete game as could not be done in the third quarter of the course and learn some basic game development concepts.

## 02. Enhanced Snake Game in Java with MVC

**Description:** Building on the Snake game, I decided to refactor it using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern. This project involved restructuring the code to separate concerns, making it more maintainable. Additionally, I integrated a *MySQL database* for storing game scores. The game now featured *multiple windows* and became a functional application.

## 03. [Part-1] Learning Python and GUI Development with Tkinter

**Description:** For my third project, I delved into Python, starting from the basics of variables and syntax and gradually advancing my skills. I then explored *Tkinter* to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This project helped me understand the power and simplicity of Python and its capabilities for GUI development.

## 03. [Part-2] Web Development with Flask and Bootstrap

**Description:** The third project also contemplates the web development project, I used **Flask**, a Python web framework, to create a simple web application. *Bootstrap* was employed for rapid design. This project allowed me to witness the potential of Python in web development and gain experience with front-end technologies that I won't see in my second year of studies.

## 04. Quiz Game in Java with MongoDB

**Description:** My most ambitious project was a quiz game developed in Java, utilizing *MongoDB* as the database. This complex project involved constant database queries, user registration, and profile management. It was a challenging endeavor that required careful design and coding to ensure smooth gameplay.

Each of these projects provided valuable learning experiences and allowed me to explore different aspects of programming and development. While they may not be perfect, they represent my journey in acquiring new skills and enhancing my understanding of various technologies.

## Reminder:

This repository is intended to learn and practice, I know that I have not strictly followed the MVC pattern and that there are many code errors, things to improve and even code that has classes that should not go there but in order to practice I cannot stay in a project so much time tweaking, added to the difficulty of passing the base game to the MVC pattern and not having created it directly like this. Is almost the same about Python web, I wanted to test it out, but in order to complete all the pending projects I have in mind before starting classes, I can't dedicate as much time as I would like to. If I may express my opinion, even though I have witnessed the potential of Python in web development, I still believe that web tools should be employed for this purpose, while Python should remain a language primarily used for desktop applications.

**Important:** I have incorporated certain images into my projects, but I want to clarify that I do not possess any rights or authority over these images. Their sole purpose is for practice and learning. These images have been obtained from image banks, and I want to emphasize that I harbor no intent to offend or infringe upon anyone or anything. My use of these images is strictly for educational purposes and practice.
