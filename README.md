# SummerDevelopment
To put the learned concepts to the test, review these concepts, and acquire new technologies and programming languages while enhancing logical reasoning, I will undertake projects in different languages.

### Reminder:

This is to learn, I know that I have not strictly followed the MVC pattern and that there are many code errors, things to improve and even code that has classes that should not go there but in order to practice I cannot stay in a project so much time tweaking, added to the difficulty of passing the base game to the MVC pattern and not having created it directly like this.
